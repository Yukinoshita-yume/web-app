打开我的网页，来到我的主页。现在是没有登录的状态。可以看到在主页看到所有的events。在卡片上可以看到event的一些基本信息，包括作者的信息。我们点开一个event，可以看到详情信息。但只能浏览，不能regist或者askquestion。如果点赞，它会跳转到登录界面。现在回到home页。可以看到底下能够翻页。上方可以筛选event。默认是open for registration.还可以选择all events.这将显示所有events。包括过期的和已经删除的。或者选择Past。只有这三个选项，因为我们还没有登录。如果是已经删除的事件，registration closes 会显示deleted。也可以进行搜索。我现在搜索Chief。可以看到全都带有Chief这个关键词。
现在我点击右上角的图标，会跳转到登录界面。如果还没有注册，点击Sign up。填写一些基本信息之后，可以进行注册。注意密码要求大小写数字，以及特殊字符。完成注册后登录主页的功能还是没有变。但是筛选选项变成了5个。这个账号已经创建和regist了一些events
点击卡片跳转到详情信息，现在可以进行register。注册完成后，我可以ask question。点击下面的点赞按钮可以进行点赞。点击delete按钮可以删除刚才的问题
点击右上角的头像跳转到个人主页。可以看到我的名字带有屏蔽词。如果你使用这个网页，它带有脏话屏蔽功能。但这个功能我写在了前端，所以如果直接通过api注入，是没有屏蔽的功能的。在这里可以看到我创建的，参加的event，以及我的提问。还可以创建新event。填写信息后创建成功。然后我还可以编辑。比如我修改这个。修改成功。如果我是作者，我不能提问。我可以删除它。删除后可以发现，状态变成了已删除
然后展示一下脏话屏蔽功能，我现在创建一个新的event。成功后，脏话会被屏蔽。就算是注册也一样，脏话会被屏蔽。这就是网页的全部功能了。

Open my website and go to the homepage. Currently, I’m not logged in. On the homepage, you can see all the events displayed. Each event card shows some basic information about the event, including details about the author.

When we click on an event, we can view its detailed information. However, in this state, we can only browse — we cannot register or ask questions. If we try to like the event, it will redirect us to the login page.

Now, returning to the home page — at the bottom, we can navigate through pages. At the top, there’s a filter for events. By default, it’s set to “Open for Registration.” You can also choose “All Events,” which displays every event, including expired and deleted ones. Or you can select “Past” — there are only these three options because we’re not logged in.

For deleted events, the “Registration Closes” label will show “Deleted.” We can also use the search function — for example, if I search “Chief,” all events containing the keyword “Chief” will appear.

Now, when I click the icon in the upper right corner, it redirects to the login page. If you haven’t registered yet, click “Sign up.” After filling in some basic information, you can register. Note that the password must include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

After logging in, the homepage still works the same, but now the filter options expand to five. This account has already created and registered for some events. When clicking an event card to view its details, I can now register for it. Once registered, I can also ask a question.

Clicking the like button at the bottom will like the event. Clicking the delete button removes the question I just posted.

If I click my avatar in the upper-right corner, it takes me to my personal profile page. Here, my username contains a censored word. This website includes a profanity filter, but it’s implemented on the frontend, so if someone directly injects data through the API, the filter won’t apply.

On my profile, I can see the events I’ve created, joined, and the questions I’ve asked. I can also create a new event by filling in the required information — after submission, the event is successfully created.

I can also edit my events — for example, modifying the details, and after saving, it updates successfully.

If I’m the author of an event, I cannot post questions on it. However, I can delete the event. After deletion, its status changes to “Deleted.”

Finally, let’s demonstrate the profanity filter: when I create a new event containing profanity, it gets automatically censored. The same happens when registering with inappropriate words — they’ll be filtered out.

And that’s the full demonstration of all the website’s features.
